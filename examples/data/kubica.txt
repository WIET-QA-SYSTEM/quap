Robert Józef Kubica (Polish pronunciation: [ˈrɔbɛrt kuˈbit͡sa] (listen); born 7 December 1984)
is a Polish racing and rally driver.
He was the first and, as of 2022, the only Polish racing driver to compete in Formula One.
Between 2006 and 2009 he drove for the BMW Sauber F1 team, promoted from test driver to race driver during 2006.
In June 2008, Kubica took his maiden and only Formula One victory at the Canadian Grand Prix.
That season he led the championship at one stage, before finishing fourth overall,
his best career position. Kubica drove for Renault in 2010 and was set to remain with the team in 2011.
Several years later Kubica confirmed he had signed a pre-contract for the 2012 season with Ferrari,
a move that was eventually cancelled by his devastating rally crash in early 2011. 
On 6 February 2011, Kubica was seriously injured in a crash at the Ronde di Andora rally,
in which his right forearm was partially severed. He was taking part to better his skills.
Kubica told Italian newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport in a bedside interview that he could
feel the fingers in his right hand and was determined to make a swift return to Formula One in 2011.
Since his return to good health, however, he initially stated that a return to Formula One would
be "nearly impossible" because of his injury. Since then, he took part in tests with Renault 
and Williams, admitting that a Formula One return in the near future was not impossible.

Kubica returned to racing in September 2012, winning a minor rally in Italy.
Kubica was named one of "The Men of the Year 2012" by Top Gear magazine for his return to auto racing. 
In 2013, he drove for Citroën in the European and World Rally-2 Championships.
He went on to win the inaugural WRC-2 title, and moved to the WRC championship full-time
in 2014, driving a Ford Fiesta RS WRC prepared by M-Sport.

On 16 January 2018, it was announced that Kubica would become the reserve driver of
Williams for the 2018 season. On 22 November 2018, Kubica was announced as a Williams
race driver for the 2019 Formula One season. He left the Williams team at the end of 2019, 
moving across to the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters, while maintaining a Formula One presence as reserve and 
test driver for Alfa Romeo. He has made several appearances during practice sessions in his role as test driver,
and he replaced Kimi Räikkönen at the Dutch and Italian Grands Prix in 2021.
